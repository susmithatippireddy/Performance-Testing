Inroduction -- Docker
What is Docker ?
Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build container images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers 
to container regestries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.

Suppose you have a web application that you want to performance test. Traditionally, you might set up multiple virtual machines or servers to simulate concurrent users and test the application's performance. 
With Docker, you can streamline this process by containerizing your application and using tools like Apache JMeter for performance testing
