What is Docker ?
Docker is a containerization platform that provides easy way to containerize your applications, which means, using Docker you can build container images, run the images to create containers and also push these containers 
to container regestries such as DockerHub, Quay.io and so on.

Suppose you have a web application that you want to performance test. Traditionally, you might set up multiple virtual machines or servers to simulate concurrent users and test the application's performance. 
With Docker, you can streamline this process by containerizing your application and using tools like Apache JMeter for performance testing

Once executed above command we can see the results will display in cmd promt.
Once we got the results,these results need to be copied and stored in a file
To do that, we should be aware of the container in which these results are stored.
